    <div id="body"><p>According to an anonymous source, it got to our attention that a final year student of olabisi onabanjo university committed suicide.</p>
    <p>
        Odemilin Evelyn from the Department of Educational Management and Business studies, Faculty of Education in OOU committed suicide after drinking Sniper (a pesticide).
    </p>
    <p>
        Reason for her action is yet to be figured out.it was reported that she cleared her phone before committing the act and warned against tracing her death that “she did it by herself”.
    </p>
   <p>
    According to people’s opinion, they request for an investigation on the case. Claiming she might be have been threatened or someone must have done it and decided to turn the table.
   </p>
   <p>
    People who are close to her should be questioned so as to know her condition before she committed the act.

May her soul rest in peace.
